## 🚀 Featured Project (Production)

### [Farmanossa - Pharmacy Delivery Data Platform](https://github.com/HenryFroio/farmanossa-expo-demo)

**Production-grade data engineering system with end-to-end ownership** - architected and built complete data platform from data sourcing to analytics delivery, processing **~38K orders/month** (~1,260/day) with Kappa Architecture.

#### Key Achievements:
```
🔹 End-to-end ownership: data sourcing (OCR) → processing (ETL) → warehousing (BigQuery) → delivery (dashboards)
🔹 $24,000+/year infrastructure cost reduction (93% reduction: $2,176/month → $156/month)
🔹 95% dashboard performance improvement (90s → 2-3s cold / 50ms cached)
🔹 2.47M+ records processed (262K in BigQuery warehouse + 2.21M real-time GPS in Firestore)
🔹 80%+ cache hit ratio with intelligent 3-layer caching
🔹 90% query scan reduction via partitioning/clustering
🔹 Custom OCR pipeline solving missing POS API integration (1,000+ orders/day, 95%+ accuracy)
```

#### Technical Highlights:
- **End-to-End Ownership:** Architected and built complete data platform independently (sourcing, ETL, warehousing, analytics)
- **Architecture:** Kappa (Firestore operational + BigQuery analytical)
- **ETL Pipelines:** ~38K+ daily transactions (15K SDK writes + 23K Cloud Functions invocations)
- **Query Optimization:** Master query with 9 CTEs (7x faster, sub-second response)
- **Cost Engineering:** Native GPS + Haversine vs Google Maps API ($2,000+/month saved)
- **Data Integration:** OCR-based ingestion (95%+ accuracy, <5s processing, zero manual entry)

**Tech Stack:** `BigQuery` `Cloud Functions` `Firestore` `Azure` `SQL` `GCP` `Cloud Scheduler`
