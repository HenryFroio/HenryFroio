## 🚀 Featured Project (Production)

### [Farmanossa - Pharmacy Delivery Data Platform](https://github.com/HenryFroio/farmanossa-expo-demo)

**Production-grade data engineering system** processing **1,000+ daily orders** with Kappa Architecture.

#### Key Achievements:
```
🔹 $6,000+/year infrastructure cost reduction
🔹 95% dashboard performance improvement (90s → 2-3s)
🔹 160K+ records in BigQuery warehouse (68K orders + 92K delivery runs)
🔹 80%+ cache hit ratio with intelligent 3-layer caching
🔹 90% query scan reduction via partitioning/clustering
🔹 Custom OCR pipeline solving missing POS API integration
```

#### Technical Highlights:
- **Architecture:** Kappa (Firestore operational + BigQuery analytical)
- **ETL Pipelines:** Serverless Cloud Functions processing 100+ orders per execution
- **Query Optimization:** Master query with 9 CTEs (7x faster, sub-second response)
- **Cost Engineering:** Native GPS + Haversine vs Google Maps API ($500/month saved)
- **Data Integration:** OCR-based ingestion (95%+ accuracy, zero manual entry)

**Tech Stack:** `BigQuery` `Cloud Functions` `Firestore` `TypeScript` `SQL` `GCP` `Cloud Scheduler`
